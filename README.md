# Prize-Collecting-Travelling-Salesman-Problem
 
This repo is focused on solving the prize collecting travelling salesman problem with two constructive heuristics.

The one shown in the heuristic_1.jl file is based on a Nearest Neighbor-type approach.

As for the one in the heuristic_2.jl file is based the Cheapest Insertion heuristic.

The parameters used for x and y axis positions as well as prizes were based on the following paper:
